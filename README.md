# Music-store-Analysis-SQL-Project
 Music store analysis based on SQL done, Music is a part of our life and we can also have insights of it based on data 


Project idea â€“ The idea behind this project is to analyse music data based on music genre , customers, singers, city,invoice, employee   

## While we have seen audio being turned into data, can we also write music as datasets?
The answer is simple: Yes! But things can get more interesting when we analyse and present beautiful insights of music for our concern.



## I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. data's given  you will learn everything on the way and be able to put it into practice straight away.
